  <h1>Ancient Whales Were the Biggest and Smallest of Their Kind to Ever Roam the Oceans</h1>

<p>The asteroid that struck the Earth 66 million years ago changed far more than life on land. Ocean ecosystems also collapsed in the aftermath of the strike, and, like the non-avian dinosaurs on land, almost all the impressive marine reptiles that had swum the ancient seas disappeared. Then, as life recovered, the oceans offered possibilities that had not been open for over 180 million years—waters virtually free of large predators. There, early whales could take the evolutionary plunge.</p>

<p>Among the most impressive of these new beasts were the basilosaurids. Named after Basilosaurus, one of the first fossil whales ever discovered, these oceanic carnivores were seagoing success stories. And a pair of recent fossil discoveries underscores how these early whales opened up a variety of niches long before the earliest dolphins or baleen whales would evolve.</p>

<p>Basilosaurus and its close relatives have long stood as epitomes of aquatic adaptation in the epic story of whale evolution. The ancestors of the first whales lived on land, but about 55 million years ago early whales were spending more time in the water. They gained adaptations such as denser bones that acted as a kind of ballast. Over millions of years, a variety of early whales lived between the shore and the open ocean, with some lineages becoming ever more adapted to a life spent entirely in the water. By 41 million years ago, whales included the basilosaurids—sinuous forms with sharp teeth, long bodies and only the vestiges of their hind legs sticking out from their sides.” </p>

<p>Against the background of aquatic adaptation, Basilosaurus has long stood out as an iconic whale no longer tied to the shore. The beast became a scientific darling because of a rich fossil record. “Much of the emphasis on Basilosaurus happens to be because we’ve known about this particular fossil species for over 175 years, and from relatively complete skeletons,” says Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History whale researcher Nicholas Pyenson.</p>

<p>That discomforting riddle—what these business machinations contribute to the actual publication of actual books—is the central question of Dan Sinykin’s “Big Fiction: How Conglomeration Changed the Publishing Industry and American Literature.” Sinykin argues that the corporate ethos that dominates the modern publishing house has exerted such an overwhelming influence on the way books are written and published that it has inaugurated a new epoch: “the Conglomerate era.” As he sees it, the consolidation of the industry that began in the nineteen-sixties and seventies transformed American fiction and “changed what it means to be an author.” The stakes of Sinykin’s inquiry are to explain “how we should read” fiction published in the U.S. during the past half century or so, a period during which every book, no matter its preoccupations or themes, could be said to reflect a greater entity: the corporation.</p>
