            <p>Book bans, burnings, and censorship – all once believed to be stains on United States history pre-civil rights and free expression – are now back and stronger than ever before.</p>

            <p>Since the beginning of the United State’s rise in book bans in 2021, censorship has only increased in schools and libraries. According to Sabrina Baêta, a researcher at PEN America who works on the free speech organization’s biannual book ban reports, the 2022-2023 school year saw a 33% increase in national book bans from the 2021-2022 school year. Overall, book bans are at their highest level since at least 2001, when the American Library Association began tracking censorship data. </p>

            <p>“And we've come up with two major instigators, which are advocacy groups – I use advocacy lightly – in that they're advocating for the removal of these materials. And then legislation,” Baêta said. 

              These advocacy groups that Baêta describes include over 50 organizations across the country, most of which espouse far-right ideals. The most influential of these groups is Moms of Liberty, an organization that pushes back against discussions of LGBTQ+ themes and critical race theory in schools. Moms for Liberty, which was formed in 2021, now has 285 chapters and has been linked to over 50% of book bans challenged by advocacy groups. 
              </p>

              <p>Many of these bans are concentrated in just a few states, with Florida and Texas leading with the most banned and challenged titles.</p>

            </script>
            
           <p>As of the 2022-2023 school year, the second most-banned book was The Bluest Eye by Toni Morrison, a story that follows a young black girl in the 1940s. The fifth most-banned book, Gender Queer: A Memoir by Maia Kobabe explores gender identity and sexuality through the author’s formative years.  

            According to PEN America, in the 2021-2022 school year, 40% of banned books addressed LGBTQ+ themes and 40% contained main characters or secondary characters of color. </p> 

            <p>
              Even though over <strong><a href="https://www.ala.org/news/press-releases/2022/03/large-majorities-voters-oppose-book-bans-and-have-confidence-libraries" target="_blank">70% of voters</a></strong> – majorities in both the Democrat and Republican parties – disapprove of increased efforts to ban books, states have turned to lawmaking to further censorship in educational settings. </p>

              <p>Successful legislation, particularly in conservative-led states, has led to scores of titles disappearing off school and public library shelves. In August 2022, Missouri passed a law that made it illegal to give minors sexually explicit material, intending to protect survivors of sexual violence. </p>

           <p>The ambiguity of this law had detrimental impacts, and it led to the removal of over 300 books from Missouri libraries. Similar laws have been passed in Florida and Utah, including Florida’s controversial bill coined the “Don’t Say Gay Bill.” </p>
           

            <iframe title="Top 5 Most Banned Books in U.S. (July 2022-June 2023)" aria-label="Donut Chart" id="datawrapper-chart-Vgqnk" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/Vgqnk/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="392" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<e.length;r++)if(e[r].contentWindow===a.source){var i=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px";e[r].style.height=i}}}))}();
            </script>
        

            <p>Fear-mongering tactics also make it more difficult for educators to push back against censorship laws. Missouri’s law states that a person who disobeys the law can serve a year in jail or pay a $2,000 fine. In Florida, educators who violate the state’s censorship laws can have their teaching certification revoked. </p>

             <p>“A lot of educators and administrators now don’t even need pressure to essentially just censor, because the fear and intimidation is so great,” said Baêta.</p> 
              
             <P>While censorship in schools impacts educators, it also has unique effects on students. In many K-12 schools, especially those that are not diverse, students only have the opportunity to think critically about other perspectives through the media they engage with at school. </P> 
              
              <p>Baêta says that the growing success of advocacy groups and legislation is harming students and their educational experiences. “By limiting information and silencing certain ideologies or groups of people, it takes away the representation of students who see themselves and their friends in these stories. Books help students better understand engage and understand other experiences,” she said. </p>
              
             <P></P> While <strong><a href= "https://www.npr.org/2023/10/17/1206219484/scholastic-book-fair-diversity-book-bans#:~:text=The%20movement%20to%20restrict%20books,2021%2D%2722%20school%20year." target="_blank">vocal minorities</a></strong> continue to pressure educators and lawmakers to continue censoring books in schools, free speech advocacy groups have fought against book bans. Groups like PEN America and the National Coalition Against Censorship are leaders in anti-censorship programming. According to Baêta, PEN America has extensive programming – including crisis management, author support, and promoting ideals of free expression in targeted communities. She says the organization is always adding new programming and working with other anti-censorship groups – like NCAC – to support and aid the cause. </p>

             <p>Ultimately, Baêta says, the best way for people to get involved is to use their voices for those who do not have the power to do so. </p>

             <p>“There’s no real point in taking away books. I’ve never regretted reading about something before experiencing it myself, and students deserve that level of critical analysis and understanding, too.”</p>
